# wills-site

This is a Django web site with a blog and a calendar.
It is a work in progress, and not all functions have 
been implimented, but what is shown works.


This started as a semester project for my Advanced
Python course, and I have been working on adding 
features slowly since.

There is also an api set up for the blog for 
voting on posts.
